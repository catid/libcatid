To statically link with some part of LibCat:
 * I recommend copying the LibCat code into your development folder, to make updating it easy.
 * Specify the path to \lib\cat\ in "Additional Library Directories" in your project linker settings.
 * Specify the name of the LibCat static library to link to in "Additional Dependencies."
 * Under C/C++ "General", specify the path to LibCat's \include\ folder in "Additional Include Directories."
 * In your source, #include <cat/AllTunnel.hpp> or whatever part you want to include.
 * You may want to examine some of the test projects to get ideas for how to use the code.

See "Build MSVC.txt" for more information.
