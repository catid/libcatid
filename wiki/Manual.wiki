#summary LibCat manual: How-to use the library

= Introduction =

LibCat is my common C++ code library.  LibCat is provides portable and efficient solutions to difficult problems using modern algorithms.

I am releasing LibCat under the LGPL so that other developers may benefit from the hard work that has been put into this code.

LibCat can be linked statically, dynamically, or included directly into your project.  Since it is open-source software, I encourage you to look through what is available and re-use what you find, in whole or in part.
