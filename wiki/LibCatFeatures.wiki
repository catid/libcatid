#summary Summary of the features provided by LibCat.

= Overview =

The library is broken into several modular components so that only the interesting subset of features may be selected for use with little to no modification:

 * *LibCatCommon* includes basic, shared features used by the rest of LibCat.

 * *LibCatCodec* provides compression.

 * *LibCatMath* provides assembly-optimized large unsigned integer arithmetic, arithmetic in a finite field with a pseudo-Mersenne modulus, and arithmetic on Twisted Edwards elliptic curves.

 * *LibCatCrypt* provides implementations of modern cryptographic primitives.

 * *LibCatTunnel* provides fast, secure Key Agreement and Authenticated Encryption for networking.

 * *LibCatFramework* provides a scalable, multithreaded framework for application development.
