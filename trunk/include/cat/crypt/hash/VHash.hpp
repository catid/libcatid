	I stripped out everything that I didn't need, including VMAC in order
	to get at the VHASH algorithm directly.  In my own library I am using
	it integrated tightly with the ChaCha cipher, and only with 8 bytes
	of output.  I stripped out a lot of the beautiful optimization work
	done by the original authors to keep my version simple.

	Read more below.

/*
	VHash

		The VHash algorithm is an exceptionally fast combinatorial hash
	that has properties sufficient for a reasonable guarantee that
	different inputs produce different hashes.  It is not a particularly
	good hash for data integrity checking.  It is also not at all a secure
	hash like SHA-256.  It is especially efficient, however, when used
	for Wegman-Carter message authentication.

		With a good encryption algorithm it can produce a Message
	Authentication Code (MAC).  I intend to use it for implementing
	VMAC-ChaCha, which is realized by adding the VHash output to zero
	bytes after they have been encrypted.

		So it will work like this:

		Step 1: Produce message IV, and use it to set up ChaCha, write it.
		Step 2: Write out 8 bytes of zeroes, and the message to encrypt.
		Step 3: Encrypt the 8 bytes of zeroes + the message with ChaCha.
		Step 4: Compute VHash for the encrypted message bytes.
		Step 5: XOR it into the encrypted zero bytes.

	This is essentially the same as encrypting VHash of the ciphertext
	since ChaCha is a stream cipher that XOR combines with plaintext.

	With this construction, the hash function is keyed, and you can
	think of VHash as a randomly-chosen hash from a family of hashes.
	An attacker would have to guess which hash is being used, and since
	the output is always encrypted, very few hints are dropped about
	the hash function key.

	Normal VMAC-AES will add the output of keyed AES to VHash as I
	understand it.  So I am basically just replacing AES with ChaCha,
	and generating some more keystream from ChaCha to cover the VHash.
